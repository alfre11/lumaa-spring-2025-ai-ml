# AI/Machine Learning Intern Challenge: Simple Content-Based Recommendation

**Deadline**: Sunday, Feb 23th 11:59 pm PST

---

## Overview

This solution implements a **content-based recommendation system** that, given a **short text description** of a userâ€™s preferences, suggests **similar items** (e.g., movies) from a small dataset. It uses the data set movies.csv (included in the repo) that contains the titles, descriptions, and other features of the top 100 IMDB movies. I utilized nltk to preprocess the data and tfidfvecotrizer and cosine_similarity from sklearn to create the similarity vectors. 


## How to run
To run simply navigate to the ipynb file and run all cells. The final cell will request an input from the user and once the desired query is inputted it will print the top 5 results.

## Desired Salary: $40/hr
   - Is your `README.md` straightforward about setup, how to run, and what to expect?

4. **ML/Recommendation Understanding**  
   - Basic implementation of a content-based recommendation approach (vectorization, similarity measure).

**We look forward to seeing your solution!** Good luck!
